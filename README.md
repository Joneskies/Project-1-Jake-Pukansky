	In this git hub I have the yaml script/playbook to set up my multiple elk stack virtual machines labeled "Elk stack playbook.txt"
it is able to setup and configure docker, python, and elk modules. It makes it easy to set up these three modules on as many machines as you would need.
	also are some commands for controlling basic linux system control to reference setting up users and group permissions and navigating/investigating a machine.
	Finally attached is a network diagram on setting up a elk stack. copy this setup in conjunction with the attached playbook, and you will be able to create a elk stack in no time at all.
